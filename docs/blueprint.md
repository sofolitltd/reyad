## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) for a professional and modern look.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212121) for a dark mode theme.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clean and readable text. 'Inter' for both headlines and body, for a clean and contemporary look.
- Use an IDE-like layout with clear sections, code snippets, and project showcases.
- Use sharp, minimalist icons from a library like Material Icons for a developer-focused look.
- Subtle transitions and animations to highlight elements and improve user experience. Try not to use zoom or other animations that change perspective; movement should remain on a single plane.
